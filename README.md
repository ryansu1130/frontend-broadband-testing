# Abstract

There is currently a massive discrepancy in broadband speeds available to people in the United States. Some people have blazing fast internet speeds, while others donâ€™t even meet the minimum requirements needed for full connectivity in the digital age. To solve this issue, the U.S. government designated The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (B.E.A.D.) Program to provide funding for the development and deployment of internet related infrastructure in order to provide for people who are underserved when it comes to broadband connectivity. The B.E.A.D. program allocates contracts and funding to private companies in exchange for infrastructure development within these underserved areas. There is however a massive problem, a problem our project helps to correct: according to our project sponsor and leader of PAgCASA Jim Cupples, Internet Service Providers are taking governmental funding in exchange for agreeing to provide services to underserved areas but they are failing to deliver this broadband service they are obligated to provide. Both in general coverage as well as speed, ISPs are misleading the Government and Public, essentially lying about the services they provide. Our project wants to help correct this issue by providing a website which will host a web application whose purpose is to illustrate the tested speeds (taken from in-person testing) in order to challenge the alleged speeds given by the ISPs. This illustration will take the shape of an interactive map of the U.S. which will graph the data of tested broadband connections provided by ISPs. Our project providers will use this application to help them determine problem areas.
